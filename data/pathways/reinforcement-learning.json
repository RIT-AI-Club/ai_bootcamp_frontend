  "description": "Master reinforcement learning from fundamentals to advanced applications. Build agents that learn through interaction with environments in games, robotics, and multi-agent systems.",
  "overview": "This pathway introduces members to the fundamentals and applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL). It begins with conceptual foundations and small toy problems, progresses through deep RL and multi-agent environments, and culminates in applied capstone projects. Each module combines video explanations, curated readings, interactive Colab notebooks, quizzes, and project work.",
